# rules_proto replacement 

# Option 1: Use Bazel's url rewriter

This is same as `Option 2` but works with for both WORKSPACE and MODULE.bazel with a single configuration.

```
rewrite http://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_proto/(.*) https://github.com/thesayyn/rules_proto/$1
```


# Option 2: Use version_override

This is essentially a `archive_override` in MODULE.bazel that looks like 

```
archive_override(
    module_name = "rules_proto",
    urls = ["https://github.com/thesayyn/rules_proto/archive/refs/heads/main.zip"],
    strip_prefix = "rules_proto-main",
)
```

and a `http_archive` early in the WORKSPACE

```
http_archive(
    module_name = "rules_proto",
    urls = ["https://github.com/thesayyn/rules_proto/archive/refs/heads/main.zip"],
    strip_prefix = "rules_proto-main",
)
```

## Upsides
- Does not need a custom registry, it works with a fork of rules_proto

## Downsides

- This will work as long as we don't need to modify MODULE.bazel as the MODULE.bazel from the BCR registry is still the source of truth. 
- Little verbose

# Option 3: Use version_override with custom registry

## Upsides

- Can change `MODULE.bazel` as we like
- Can publish a module with rules_proto name, with no political games.

## Downsides

- Needs a fork of bazel-central-registry

```
single_version_override(
    module_name = "rules_proto",
    registry = "https://raw.github.com/buf/bazel-central-registry"
)
```
